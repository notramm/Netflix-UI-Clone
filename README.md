## What it is

A basic warmup exercise. Simple, practice oriented, clone of the Netflix Homepage. Built with:

- HTML
- CSS

## What it does

- Look pretty, that's about it :-)

## Learning Points

- CSS Grid
- Styling Tables
- Positioning

> Also (Just a thought), You could advance this by adding some animations to the selector borders etc.

## Features in Development

I might add the other pages on the Netflix website if I ever come back to refactor ^-^
